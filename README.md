# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
For this project I was tasked with creating a console interface using Inquirer to allow the user to create a dynamically generated webpage that would contain the members of their company along with their information relative to their position. I also had to use Jest to run tests on the various functions found in each employee class. 
I had a lot of fun building this project and I hope you enjoy.
